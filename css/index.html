          <h2>Chicken</h2>
The perfect fried chicken has a skin that should induce lust like the thought of sweat-soaked bodies in a well-ventilated room. It should be thicc, golden and crispy.
It should be a craggy alpine landscape of deep-fried goodness, with crispy batter peaks, ravines of fragrant fat, and ridges rich with umami. When you bite down,
it should give away with a deep, resonant cruunnnnchhhhhhhhhh,
followed by a squelch as the chicken tapestry unravels into fat, spice, and everything nice.
As for flavour, it’s all up to personal preference. Some prefer a Korean drumstick coated in sweet soy glaze. Others crave wingettes marinated in Har Cheong Gai paste.
There is no right or wrong answer, so long as those flavours do not overpower the chicken proper.
The same holds true for the most common cuts of fried chicken: thigh, breast/rib, and wing. Chicken fanatics will argue for the merits of wing over thigh,
or denounce breast-eaters as heretics who should be burned at the stake, but their argument must not be taken seriously; every piece of deep-fried chicken is a Faustian bargain.
The wing is the most tender and flavourful, but it’s finicky to eat and contains less meat. The breast has the most meat, but it’s nowhere as tender or crispy.
Your thigh is designed for easy eating, but it has less bulk than the breast and less flavor than the wing because it contains a lower skin-to-flesh ratio.
Whatever your choice, you cannot win or lose.
Fried chicken is just—it does not taketh without giving, nor give without taking something away. What one loses in crispiness is gained in convenience or more chicken.
